# How to build Hubble
After checking out the source code, use your favorite IDE to import the
Hubble project (located in AndroidStudioProject).

Then proceed to build project via the way that your IDE allows you to.

Below are instructions that are specific to (and have been tested on) Android
Studio (version 3.5).

1. Launch Android Studio.

2. Import the Hubble project by navigating to `File`->`Open`, and then browsing
to the location you have downloaded this repository to, and choose `Hubble` in
`AndroidStudioProject`.

3. Sync all the settings or project configurations by `File`->`Sync Project with
Gradle Files`.

4. Build the project by `Build`->`Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)`->`Build APK(s)`.

5. An `Event Log` layout should appear. In the logs, it should tell you where
the build result is located. You can also do so by clicking on the `locate` link
within the `Event Log` window layout.
